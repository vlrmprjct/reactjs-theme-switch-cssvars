This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

ReactJS Example switching css4-vars something like this:
 ```
:root {
    --background-primary: $color-eastbay;
    --text-primary:       $color-gray1;
}
```

## Browser Support
To support IE11 we have to use the `css-vars-ponyfill` npm package.


## Todo
* add saving user settings, maybe use `localstorage`
* ~~add useful themenames instead numbers~~ [Check `feature/get-theme-by-name` branch]
